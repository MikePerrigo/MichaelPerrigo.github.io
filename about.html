												<h3>About Me</h3>
											</header>
											<p>My name is Mike, and I've been in the world of QA and Automation for 12 years now. I have a unique background, one that started in Mechanical Engineering. I spent two years
                                                at the University of Maine in the Mechanical Engineering Technology program. I spent my days in an advanced science or math class, or in something involving machining and materials. 
                                                I've milled my own tool set, built an air powered engine and learned to run a CNC machine. Eventually I realized that wasn't the career path I wanted so I transferred home to something 
                                                that provoked thoughts in a different way, Philosophy, Psychology and English. I gained invaluable skills in communication and analysis, and landed an internship doing tech preparation 
                                                for a content management company. The infatuation with the tech side of things led me back to school to get a second degree in Information Systems and some coursework in Computer Science. </br></br>

                                                From there I landed my first SQA role at a medical device robotics company where I used my mechanical knowledge to break robotics, and then analyzed how the software reacted and rebounded. 
                                                There was work with SQL to track Assay's, automation for smoke test runs, and test cases abiding by strict regulations in a heavily governed space. That put me down the path of automation and 
                                                testing out software for a career. </br></br>

                                                I learned what I could about Python first, as that was what we used at my first automation-heavy job. I then took those principles and tried to have us adopt a new framework, Cypress. It was relatively
                                                new, only on version 2 and I've been a power user ever since. I like tools that do a lot of things well and allow for flexibility within your automation suites. </br></br>

                                                I'm an avid learner, and have recently started working with Playright and JUnit. I'm an automation-minded, well-versed QA engineer with experience in some of the most heavily scrutinized industries. 
                                                I'm always up for a new experience or challenge. </br></br>

                                                I currently reside in Beverly, MA with my Wife and Daughter. I'm open to hybrid work as I like to get out of the house, and I've always enjoyed my time in the office, but I have also been fully remote on
                                                globally dispersed teams for the last 6 years. </br></br>

                                                Thanks for stopping by!
                                            </p>

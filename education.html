                                            <h5>Bachelors of Science in Information Systems - University of Massachusetts Lowell</h5>
                                            <p>UMass Lowell had a second bachelors program which allowed you to skip gen ed classes and take all electives for 2 years to attain a second bachelors if you already had one. 
                                                I took the opportunity to get my second bachelors in Information Systems where I focused on Networking and Infrastructure, as well as basic programming classes. 
                                            </p>
                                            <h5>Bachelors of Arts in Psychology and Philosophy - Merrimack College</h5>
                                            <p>After spending two years at UMaine I decided to transfer home and change majors. I switched to Philsopohy and Psycholody with a minor in English to attain better communication and thought skills. 
                                                I got a lot of exposure to communication courses, sociology, as well as the more focused psycology and philosophy courses.
                                            </p>
                                            <h5>Mechanical Engineering Technology - University of Maine</h5>
                                            <p>I spent two eyars at UMaine working towards a degree in Mechanical Engineering Technology. This is more of the build side of things than Mechanical Engineering, which focuses on design. 
                                                With this, I spent a lot of time in Machine Tool lab working with CNC machines, Drill Press, Lathes, and machining my own tool sets. I did also spend time in drafting and design, as well as advanced math
                                                and strengths of materials classes. Eventually I decided this path wasn't for me and transferred home to pursue another degree.
                                            </p>
